This is a temperature converter that I wrote in Rust, as part of my learning journey. Rust is a programming language that I have been interested to learn since last year, after seeing how it always appeared first (and by a wide margin) on the Most Loved Programming Languages section from [Stack Overflow's 2020 Developer Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#technology-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-languages).

Obviously, considering its complexity I was "intimidated" at first to try it, but just like all things in life, you eventually have to face your own fears...

The program was written after reading until the section 3.1 of [The Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). Additional resources were consulted on [Tutorialspoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/rust/index.htm) as well.

Obviously, it is highly possible that I will end up changing parts of the code after reading subsequent sections, but at this point it is a solid small program that does not break, even when you introduce wrong inputs.
